## Github Searcher
This project contains the frontend for the Github Search Application. It allows any user to type a search value and filter by three different categories: Users, Repositories, and Issues. The data is returned and displayed in cards inside a grid.

## Motivation
This project was created as a result of a code challenge provided by Tradeling. More details on the code challenge implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/tradeling/coding-tasks/tree/develop/fullstack-javascript).
